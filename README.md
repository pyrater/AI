#AI LLM Bots

Project Name is an open-source project that aims to provide a solution for LLM (Language Model) processing. It utilizes HTML, JavaScript as a front-end, and a PHP backend to make API calls to Oobabooga.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was the lack of open-source alternatives for LLM processing on the web. Many existing websites offering similar functionality were closed-source, which limited customization and extensibility. This project was initiated as a fun and educational endeavor to create an open-source solution that anyone can contribute to and enhance.

## Features

- HTML and JavaScript front-end for user interaction and input.
- PHP backend for making API calls to Oobabooga.
